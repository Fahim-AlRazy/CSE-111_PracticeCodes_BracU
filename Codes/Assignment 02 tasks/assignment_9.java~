9. Write a Java Code to display the multiplication table for a given positive integer 'n'. The
table should include the products of 'n' with each of the numbers from 1 to 10. For
example, if n = 5, your code should output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
...
5 x 10 = 50
[You are not allowed to use loops to solve this problem.]
